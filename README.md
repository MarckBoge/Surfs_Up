# Surfs_Up
A weather analysis using SQLite and SQLAlchemy. To building an web application using Flask, Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Overview

This Project encompasses using a dataset containing weather conditions that have been stored in a SQLite database, to provide information to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu is a sustainable business year-around. The investor is hesitant due to past failed ventures due to weather conditions.In order to get the investor on board I will need to provide a detailed analysis on the weather conditions in Oahu that will convince him that this will be a successful business venture.

In conculsion, I would summarizes my findings that even though the temperature recorded in December fluctuations throughout the month, December still provides optimal weather conditions for both surfing and a demand for ice cream. The average temperature in June and December only varies by only 4 degrees. Also the yearly average is 74 degrees F with a max of 87 degrees F perfect weather for surfing and ice cream.
